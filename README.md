Developer - Steve Hannay
Completed - 9th Jan 2024


## Description

The aim of this project is to create a webpage which can generate a password based upon user specified criteria.

The following acceptance criteria was set for by the project :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Generate a password when the button is clicked

    * Present a series of prompts for password criteria

    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
    
    * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
    
    * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the process of working on this project I have learned more about the fundamentals of javascript coding, including the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, random numbers and event handling. 

Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.
